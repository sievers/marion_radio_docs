2017_astro_takeover_report.pdf - report from takeover voyage completed
in May 2017 showing first science deployment of the PRIZM cosmic dawn
antennas on Marion Island.  Note the complete lack of RFI (other than
Orbcomm satellites at 137 MHz).

marion_uv_juniors.png - UV coverage from Marion huts plus a station at
our current PRIZM deployment site behind Junior's.  The addition of
the Junior's site significantly improves the coverag of NS baselines.

marion_beam_juniors_5MHz.png - instantaneous beam using coverage
between 3.5 and 7 MHz from the UV plot in marion_uv_juniors.png.  The
current state of the art is from Tasmania decades ago, with a beam
larger than this entire image.
